# WIP - Portfolio site

### What is this about?

- a first draft of my portfolio site where I try out things
- at time of writing, nothing's final, not even content

### Preconditions

- build this with HTML, SCSS, (plain) JavaScript
- try out [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html), as a less work intense bundler than Webpack

### How to run this?

- clone the repo
- cd into project
- run `npm install`
- when running the project for the first time, run `npm run build` to have it build the first time
- this should fire up the server at http://localhost:1234
- after that you can run the project in running `npm start`
- stop the server with `control c`
